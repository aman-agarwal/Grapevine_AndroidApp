Basic Camera Activity

The UI design is based on Photo Feed. The activity is started when the user selects "Add Photo" in the Photo Feed menu. On creation, a photo is captured using the phone's camera app and displayed. The user can then edit the title and description, and finally upload using the Upload icon.

The Upload button will be implemented later. 

This functionality will be tested once the Photo Feed bug is resolved.
